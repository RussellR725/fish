This code is a simple website which will track Fish games and create a ranking system.
It is rather informal now and if it gets enough attention or will I will do an update to it and make it Finding Nemo themed.
This uses php and Sql database to run and make sure you correctly configure the database connection.

A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards startups, app devs, and other
dedicated folks working tirelessly to launch their products. Includes a landing page,
generic page, contact page, and a page with a whole mess of pre-styled elements (something
new I'm trying out). Sass sources are also included.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
